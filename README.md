>You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
>
>**What new skills have you learned?**

The skills that I learned, aside from formatting plain-text to HTML text, was to learn how to actually 'google' it may sounds absurd, but if you really know how to use google search operators, it'll really speed up finding what you need.

>**What has been easy?**

Everything about the project was quite easy as I had previous knowledge of HTML.

>**What has been difficult?**

 What I always found difficult: is reading the Documentation. For some reason, I find the wording of 'official' documentation over at MDN and W3 Schools to be very stiff and 'formal'. Other sources such as blogs, what-not usually have more beginner friendly wording, and use a colloquial style of writing. OR  Maybe I feel this way because English is not my first language.

>**How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?**

The problem solving strategies I used was to make use of the wide variety of resources available me all over the net, There are hundreds of 'learn HTML' resources out there. But the ones that I kept coming back to was MDN and W3 Schools. I already had taken a basic HTML course on CodeAcademy so it was all a matter of looking up the tags that weren't familiar to me.
